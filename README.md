# Distributed_Recommendation_Inference_on_FPGA_Clusters
This repository corresponds to FPL'21 paper: Distributed Recommendation Inference on FPGA Clusters. The FPGAs are interconnected using 100 Gbps network switch and each FPGA is equipped with an open-source 100 Gbps TCP/IP network stack (https://github.com/fpgasystems/Vitis_with_100Gbps_TCP-IP). The FPGAs are organized in a deep pipelined fashion to accelerate the DNN computation of the recommender system.
